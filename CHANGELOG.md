# Changes

## Edition 2.0-RC (lexicon 1.0-RC) - May 19, 2021

_Release Candidate_

Target: repair the post-processing steps.

- Lexicon content updates:
  - Several bunches of updates from PE/17 and other minor fixes
- Lexicon structure overhaul:
  - Removal of old generated elements (artifacts from the recovered lexicon)
  - Switch to UTF8 encoding and LF end-of-lines
  - Removal of the outdated German translation and notes
- Tooling:
  - Recovered post-processing scripts, so expansion of cross-references,
    entry sorting, homograph (re-)numbering, sectioning are all back into
    action.

## Edition 2.0-a6 (lexicon 1.0-alpha9) - May 16, 2021

Target: make it look nice again.

- Lexicon (with apologies to those involved... sometimes years ago):
  - Several bunches of updates from PE/17.
    For the record, it represents around 60-70% of the old so-called "C0421" notes (with special thanks whom it concerns, efforts from around 2014 or later).
    Support for PE/17 is still fairly incomplete.
  - Several other fixes and updates (special thanks to Gabor L., feedback from around 2011-2012).
  - And more fixes and updates here and there.
- The project now has a "live version" via "GitHub Pages".
- Previous version was mostly focussed on re-assembling a working version, but the generated output was somehow ugly...
  - Improved HTML5/CSS3 layout
  - Repaired project information (header, with toggle)
  - Clickable words:
    - GitHub integration for easier issue reporting
    - Eldamo integration, just because.

## Edition 2.0-a5x (lexicon 1.0-alpha5) - April 2020 (from 2019 recovery)

Target: assemble a working lexicon again.

- Entries from PE/17 are *very* partially taken into account.
  We have not checked how far we went in the 2011-2014 effort, and how much of this work could be recollected.
- Entries from PE/18 to PE/22, and up to VT/50 (incl.) are expected to all have been taken into account, and should also have been checked for completeness.
- Some old entries were fixed, with the inputs from the abovementioned sources.
- Some old fixes reported on the (now defunct) sindarin dictionary mailing list were included.
  At this point, it was assumed that the backlog of former reports (on the list or by mail to the former editor) was processed.
- Many entries use a newer and better reference scheme (with "bibl" tags in words and in defitinions, rather than a single "sources" note
  collated at the end of an entry) - though this is not complete. Hence the colors in the default output.
- French translations were added accordingly for all new or corrected entries, though unrevised. 
  The German translations however were only sparingly touched and are best avoided. (They are excluded from the default output.)
