## Edition 2.0-a5x (lexicon 1.0-alpha5) - 2019 recovery

- Entries from PE/17 are *very* partially taken into account.
  We have not checked how far we went in the 2011-2014 effort, and how much of this work could be recollected.
- Entries from PE/18 to PE/22, and up to VT/50 (incl.) are expected to all have been taken into account, and should also have been checked for completeness.
- Some old entries were fixed, with the inputs from the abovementioned sources.
- Some old fixes reported on the (now defunct) sindarin dictionary mailing list were included.
  At this point, it was assumed that the backlog of former reports (on the list or by mail to the former editor) was processed.
- Many entries use a newer and better reference scheme (with "bibl" tags in words and in defitinions, rather than a single "sources" note
  collated at the end of an entry) - though this is not complete. Hence the colors in the default output.
- French translations were added accordingly for all new or corrected entries, though unrevised. 
  The German translations however were only sparingly touched and are best avoided. (They are excluded from the default output.)
