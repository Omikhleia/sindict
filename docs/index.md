### A non-authoritative Sindarin and Noldorin dictionary in XML (TEI) format.

Most people landing on this page are probably interested in the latest [generated build](dict-sd.html) from the sources.

People interesting to browse the source XML and scripts (or report issues etc.) may want to check the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Omikhleia/sindict).

If you are looking for a more complete comprehensive scholarly dictionary of Tolkien's invented languages, [Eldamo](https://github.com/pfstrack/eldamo)
is certainly what you are looking for.
