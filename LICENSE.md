# License applying to the Dictionary

The "Dictionary" (or Lexicon) in this repository consists in one or more XML
files, and any derived by-product or rendering of them in any form, including
but not limited to the generated HTML version(s) included in this repository.

This material may be distributed only subject to the terms and conditions
set forth in the **Creative Commons Attribution, Non-Commercial, Share-Alike

**Additional limitation of scope**:

Sindarin and Noldorin, as languages invented by J.R.R. Tolkien, are his artistic and
intellectual property. The editors do not claim any intellectual property on these
languages and, as a whole, on this dictionary, beyond the editorial annotations, the
arrangement of entries and the encyclopaedic discussions or interpretations
appended to these entries. The above-mentioned license applies to such elements
only.

J.R.R. Tolkien's texts and books are copyrighted by the Tolkien Estate and/or Tolkien's
publishers. As of yet, this material is not approved by the Tolkien Estate or Tolkien's
publishers, and is henceforth an unauthorized Sindarin and Noldorin dictionary. This
material is however provided under the editors' assumption that compiling, arranging,
analyzing, normalizing and annotating entries in order to produce a dictionary for a
language, even if it is an invented one, does not violate the copyright of the inventor.

Shall any third party include this material in a derived work, under the above-mentioned
license or under any other applicable license, the editors will not be liable for possible
infringement of copyright on the derived work. Every derived use of this material is left
under the sole responsability of the third party.

Notwithstanding, this material is neither a verbatim reproduction of information
from Tolkien's published works, nor a simple rearrangement of such information in
a different order. Many entries are deduced from indirect evidences (such as
compounds, inflected forms, etc.) or are normalized according to our current
knowledge of the Sindarin phonology and morphology. As a consequence, some
deductions, as presented by the editors or by other contributors to the dictionary,
might actually prove incorrect or inaccurate when new information is published.

Any violation of copyright regarding yet unpublished texts by J.R.R. Tolkien is
unintended. The compiler does not have any access to hitherto unpublished texts.
Would it be the case, such texts would not be used in the dictionary. Therefore,
this dictionary only contains entries based on published texts, either from
direct attestations or based on deductions and conclusions drawn from these texts
by careful comparisons.
