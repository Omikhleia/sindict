# sindict
A non-authoritative Sindarin and Noldorin dictionary in XML (TEI) format.

The original "Sindarin dictionary project" (a.k.a. _HiswelokÃ«'s Sindarin Dictionary_) began on Oct. 23, 1999 and was never completed.
Around 2008, the project went on hiatus. There was an effort to revive it in 2011-2014, with a number of core changes that included a
new format. The original XML file being converted and split in smaller subsets. This went very messy after the former editor got
robbed in 2014. To keep the story short here, the new tooling and sources were then lost. The project was all broken, in scattered pieces...

This is an attempt made around 2019 to repair and share a somehow working XML/TEI version (it proved to be the easiest path), reassembling what could be
reconstructed from ealier versions, somehow playing Lego(tm) with e-mails, some manual chirurgical glue and some automated back-conversions and
reassembly...

_As of yet, this repository is mostly for archival, as a testimony of the past_. 

The former editor has no plan currently to resume the project.

If you are looking for a more up-to-date and comprehensive scholarly dictionary of Tolkien's invented languages, [Eldamo](https://github.com/pfstrack/eldamo)
is certainly what you are looking for.
